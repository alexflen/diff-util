# Problem statement

In this project, it is required to implement a simple analogue of the [diff utility] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff ),
which calculates the difference between two text files in the form of a sequence of inserted and deleted lines,
allowing you to get the second one from the first file. It is not necessary to take into account changes inside the lines.

The solution can be based on the algorithm [search for the largest common subsequence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem ),
but this is optional. You need to develop and describe the user interface yourself
the program interface, input and output data formats, organize testing, make sure
that the program works with sufficiently large files, provide sets of files for verification
correctness of implementation. Development should be carried out regularly, the commit history should reflect
the development process, it is recommended to write commit messages in English
(but messages in Russian are also allowed).
